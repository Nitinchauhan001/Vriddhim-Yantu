            <p>On July 3, 2025, SEBI temporarily banned the hedge fund Jane Street from the Indian markets, saying it
                had manipulated index options, netting hundreds of crores in profits — unfairly, and repeatedly.</p>

            <p>This is huge. Jane Street is no ordinary entity. It’s one of the world’s most prominent proprietary
                trading firms. It’s famed for its secrecy, its math-driven culture, and elite talent pool drawn from top
                academic institutions. It brings all of this to bear in markets across the world. That is who SEBI has
                now gone after.</p>

            <p>But what exactly did Jane Street do? What was this strategy? Why did SEBI come down so hard?</p>

            <p>Let’s walk through everything, step by step.</p>

            <h2>How it all started</h2>

            <p>It all began in a New York courtroom.</p>

            <p>In early April 2024, Jane Street had filed a lawsuit against another hedge fund — Millennium Management.
                It accused Millennium of stealing a proprietary, multi-billion dollar trading strategy. Specifically,
                the strategy involved trading index options in Indian markets.</p>

            <p>The two Wall Street giants quickly settled the case. But the case caught everyone’s attention.</p>

            <p>Until then, nobody really knew what Jane Street was doing in India. And they definitely didn’t know that
                Jane Street’s involvement went to a level where they felt the need to sue someone over a “secret”
                strategy. What was so special about this strategy? Why did Jane Street seem to think it was worth
                billions?</p>

            <p>SEBI saw that lawsuit too. And the fact that the strategy in question involved Indian index options —
                something SEBI actively regulates — made it impossible to ignore.</p>

            <h2>SEBI starts digging</h2>

            <p>SEBI started studying the matter in April 2024. They went through Jane Street’s trading data, looking
                especially at expiry days — when weekly index options like BANKNIFTY would settle.</p>

            <p>There were many trades Jane Street would make. But among them, it found one repeated pattern:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Jane Street would buy and sell the stocks that made up BANKNIFTY aggressively.</li>
                <li>On the same days, they made massive profits in BANKNIFTY options — especially in those that expired
                    the same day.</li>
                <li>The two, it seemed, were linked. They would buy stocks aggressively to push the index up. At the
                    same time, they would bet against the index using cheap options. Then, they would dump the stocks.
                    As the index fell, they’d book their profits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This all looked like a coordinated, pre-planned strategy. So SEBI expanded its investigation. It reached
                out to NSE, asking for the full set of data for expiry days. That’s when SEBI saw just how perfectly
                Jane Street’s stock and options trades lined up on expiry days, when things escalated.</p>

            <p>Eventually, SEBI asked NSE to formally look into these patterns as well. NSE issued a formal letter of
                caution to Jane Street in February 2025, asking them to refrain from large expiry-day trades, and the
                specific patterns that SEBI found suspicious.</p>

            <p>Jane Street responded, claiming the trades were legitimate, and based on “proprietary strategies”.</p>

            <p>SEBI didn’t buy that — especially not after seeing the data. In all the trades the firm made, there was a
                strand where the trading patterns just seemed too consistent, too perfectly aligned, and too profitable,
                in a way that suggested Jane Street had found a loophole, and was exploiting it repeatedly.</p>

            <h2>The investigation deepens</h2>

            <p>SEBI went through a long stretch of Jane Street’s trading activity — 18 different expiry days between
                October 2023 and March 2025. One particular day stood out: January 17, 2024. This was Jane Street’s
                single most profitable day, where the fund earned a staggering ₹734.93 crore from index options alone.
            </p>

            <p>The kind of number demanded a closer look.</p>

            <p>The day seemed to showcase the full version of what the regulator later called the “Intraday Index
                Manipulation” strategy — a pattern that re-appeared on 15 out of the 18 days it was looking at.</p>

            <p>On that day, the market had opened on a weak note. HDFC Bank’s earnings seemed disappointing, the night
                before. But then, for a couple of hours, the BANKNIFTY index bounced back sharply, only to crash again.
            </p>

            <div class="text-center mb-4">
                <img src="./images/daily4-article-img1.webp" alt="umeralla pattern" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            </div>

            <p>Jane Street’s own trades, SEBI realised, lined up exactly with that reversal. We’ll get to that shortly.
                But first, you need to understand two key ideas:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The first has to do with the BANKNIFTY. The value of the BANKNIFTY index depends entirely on the
                    prices of its twelve underlying bank stocks. Some of those, like HDFC and ICICI Bank, make up more
                    than a quarter of the index. If you can push just those stocks up, the entire index goes up. Push
                    them down, and the index drops. That link — between the stocks and the index — is exactly what Jane
                    Street exploited.</li>

                <li>The other key detail is the importance of the expiry day. On that day, any position that hasn’t been
                    closed or squared off is settled based on where the index trades during the last half hour of the
                    day. And so, options are extremely sensitive to moves in the underlying index. On these days, the
                    options market goes wild. Volumes explode. For example, on Jan 17, BANKNIFTY options saw around
                    ₹10,000 crore worth of premium turnover — 353 times the value of the trades in the actual stocks
                    themselves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>So What Did Jane Street Do?</h4>

            <p>On Jan 17, Jane Street did two things, one after the other. Together, they tell the full story of the
                strategy that earned SEBI’s ire.</p>

            <h2>Part I: The rise (9:15 AM – 11:47 AM)</h2>

            <p>That morning, Jane Street started buying large quantities of BANKNIFTY stocks — Axis Bank, Kotak, ICICI,
                and others — in both the cash and futures markets. Their orders were so aggressive that they pushed
                prices up, leading to a temporary rally in the BANKNIFTY index.</p>

            <div class="text-center mb-4">
                <img src="./images/daily4-article-img2.webp" alt="umeralla pattern" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            </div>

            <div class="text-center mb-4">
                <img src="./images/daily4-article-img3.webp" alt="umeralla pattern" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            </div>

    

            <p>SEBI found that in many of these stocks, Jane Street’s buying made up 15–25% of total market volume over
                that time. At that very time, though, they were also betting on the index falling:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>They were selling call options, or bets that the index won’t rise</li>
                <li>They were buying put options, or bets that the index will fall</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Together, this meant Jane Street was positioning itself for a fall, while whipping up the illusion of a
                recovery for the rest of the market. This is what SEBI calls deceptive.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: The fall (11:49 AM – 3:30 PM)</h2>

            <p>At this point, they flipped the script. They started selling all those banking stocks and BANKNIFTY
                futures they'd bought earlier.</p>

            <div class="text-center mb-4">
                <img src="./images/daily4-article-img4.webp" alt="umeralla pattern" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            </div>
    

            <p>It was expiry day. The smallest movements in the index had an outsized impact on the value of some
                options — especially the ones that were At The Money (ATM).</p>

            <p>An ATM option is one where the strike price — the level at which the contract becomes profitable — is
                very close to the current price of the index. These are the most sensitive to last-minute moves. There’s
                no time left, and they’re at the very edge of profitability — just a few points can decide whether they
                end up worth lakhs or expire worthless.</p>

            <p>When Jane Street dumped those stocks in the final hours of the session, it pushed the index way down.
                Their bets had come true. The put options they bought were suddenly exploding in value. They went from
                being borderline worthless to deep in-the-money, all in the space of an hour or two.</p>

            <p>And since they held a lot of these, the payoff was huge. Those put they bought became massively
                profitable. The calls they sold became worthless. All told, on that one day, Jane Street made ₹734.93
                crore in net profits from options alone.</p>

            <p>But the thing is, Jane Street wasn’t lucky. It didn’t get a prediction right. It made its own luck, in a
                sense. It created the very market move that it had bet on.</p>

            <p>That move — where someone trades heavily in the last 30 minutes to push the index in a certain direction
                — is called “marking the close”. It is globally considered market manipulation, and is illegal.</p>

            <p>Across all 18 days that SEBI studied, their options profit added up to roughly ₹43,000 crore, while
                losing ~₹7,500 crore in the other segment while implementing this strategy.</p>

            <div class="text-center mb-4">
                <img src="./images/daily4-article-img5.webp" alt="umeralla pattern" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            </div>
    

            <h2>Why was that wrong?</h2>

            <p>Here’s SEBI’s view: Jane Street was shaping the market. Jane Street’s trades were so large, and placed so
                aggressively, that they moved prices on their own. In many of the BANKNIFTY’s constituent stocks — like
                Kotak, Axis, ICICI — Jane Street alone accounted for a fifth of all trading activity in short pockets of
                time. That was enough to push the market wherever Jane Street wanted it to go.</p>

            <p>When they started aggressively buying those stocks that morning, they had an agenda: make other traders
                think more demand was coming in. Prices started rising, pushing up the index.</p>

            <p>That was the setup. Behind the scenes, Jane Street was aggressively betting that the index would fall by
                the end of the day.</p>

            <p>As others bought into the idea that the index would keep rising, Jane Street reversed their trades,
                dumping the same stocks they’d just bought, pushing the index back down. They bet on an outcome and then
                forced it to happen.</p>

            <p>In SEBI’s eyes, that’s the wrong way to win a bet.</p>

            <h2>The aftermath</h2>

            <p>SEBI’s banned Jane Street from the Indian markets, for now. They’ve also impounded ₹4,840 crore, money
                that it thinks definitely came from the strategy.Here’s what Nithin thinks about this entire issue:
                SEBI’s move was necessary — but it also shows how heavily the market leans on firms like Jane Street.
                They drive nearly half of all options volumes. When someone of this scale pulls back, the entire market
                feels the tremors.</p>

            <h2>Other market actions by SEBI</h2>

            <p>Meanwhile, SEBI is actively trying to reduce the volatility caused by weekly options, especially on
                expiry days. In November 2024, they introduced rules that limited weekly options trading to just two
                major indices—NIFTY and SENSEX—and added extra margins on expiry day, along with other risk-control
                measures.</p>

            <p>Then in May 2025, SEBI brought in another set of reforms. These included a new way of calculating market
                open interest using option delta. They also raised position limits for individual firms. The goal was to
                reduce the risk of any single participant impacting the market too much.</p>

            <p>Together, these steps reflect SEBI’s broader push to keep expiry-day chaos in check and make the options
                market more resilient.</p>
